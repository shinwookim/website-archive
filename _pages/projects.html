    - name: Analysis of Sorting Algorithms
      description: >
        Using a formal approach, analyzed the run-time and space requirements for five sorting algorithms: [QuickSort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort), Median of Three QuickSort, RandomPivot, Median of Five QuickSort, and MergeSort. Then, implemented these algorithms in Java and verified the results empirically.

    #- name: ReallyLongInt
    #  description: >
    #    Implemented a Java class (called `ReallyLongInt`) backed by a doubly linked-list that supports storing and manipulating integers of arbitrary sizes, including those that are outside the bounds of the standard `java.lang.Integer` object. I.e., implemented a Java class analagous to the `java.math.BigInteger` class. A separate variation of the object was also created that only utilizes recursive methods.

      description: >
        A logical circuit design for a 16-bit CPU based on the Harvard computer architecture that shares many characteristics with early MIPS processors. CPU2224 supports ALU operations, load-stores, input-output, and control flow operations including conditional jumps, as well as function call instructions (like jump-and-link). The circuitry was created using [Logism](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/), a free educational tool for designing and simulating logic circuits; it supports loading and executing programs written in an MIPS-like assembly.

      description: >
        A 2D adventure game made in the style of the classic *Legend of Zelda* game. This game was written entirely in [MIPS assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_architecture) from scratch using the [MARS MIPS assembler](https://courses.missouristate.edu/kenvollmar/mars/). Within the game, there is a variety of weapon choices, functioning enemy AI, and a score system.
