            I worked with Dr. Zuzana Swigonova(University of Pittsburgh, Department of Biology) and her team in creating a free, open-source library of macromolecular complexes which can be 3d-printed, or viewed online for classroom educational purposes. I created a <a href="https://touchtheinvisible.com">website</a> which displays the 3D macromoleculear models and the accompanying information sheet using open source APIs. In addition, I created a content-management-system(CMS) to manage all the assets and to allow for non-technical staff members to edit the website without learning to code.
