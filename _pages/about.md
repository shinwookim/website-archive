I am an undergraduate student at the [University of Pittsburgh's](https://pitt.edu) [School of Computing and Information](https://sci.pitt.edu) and the [University Honors College](https://www.honorscollege.pitt.edu/) studying **computer science** and **mathematics**. I'm originally from Seoul, South Korea, and have lived in many amazing places including Pacific Grove (California), Philadelphia, and Pittsburgh. I have a passion for teaching. I was the President of the Tutoring Program at North Penn Senior High School, and I was the Co-Founder/Instructor of the school's free SAT® prep class. Recently, I taught the [CompTIA A+ Certificate](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/a) course to high school students in Pittsburgh’s Hill District. My research interests are in the field of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing although there are very few things in computer science that I'm _not_ interested in. Outside of school, I enjoy spending most of my time outdoors. In the winter, I am an avid skier. And during the warmer months, I enjoy hiking. When forced indoors, I spend my time watching movies and television shows.
