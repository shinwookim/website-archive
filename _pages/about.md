My name is Shinwoo Kim, and I am a graduate (MS) student at the [University of Pittsburgh](https://pitt.edu)'s [School of Computing and Information](https://sci.pitt.edu) studying Computer Science. My current interests are in the field of **computer systems, operating systems, and computer architecture**, although there are only a few things in computer science that I'm *not* interested in. Currently, I work as a [teaching assistant/part-time faculty]({{ '/teaching/' | prepend: site.baseurl }}) for Pitt's computer science department where I love trying new techniques to help students learn. Additionally, I also am the Lead Software Developer for the [*TouchTheInvisible*](https://touchtheinvisible.com) project at the University of Pittsburgh.

Previously, I worked as the STEM ambassador[^sponser] at Pitt's [Hill District Community Engagement Center](https://cec.pitt.edu/hilldistrict/) where I taught K-12/young adult students about computer science and information technology. I was also a founding member of the [Special Needs Acceptance Project](https://snapfse.com/), a Pittsburgh organization which promotes the awareness of Neurodiverse[^neurodiverse] communities, and served on the inaugural advisory board.<span class="endmark"></span>
