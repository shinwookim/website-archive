![Shinwoo Kim](../assets/img/profile.jpg){: width="250" .d-block .img-fluid .rounded .float-start .me-2 .mb-0} I am student at the [University of Pittsburgh](https://pitt.edu)'s [School of Computing and Information](https://sci.pitt.edu) & [David C. Frederick Honors College](https://www.frederickhonors.pitt.edu/) where I am studying **computer science**, **data science**, and **mathematics**. 

Upon completion of my undergraduate studies, I plan on applying to graduate school to further my knowledge in computer science. My research interests are in the field of **Artificial Intelligence**, **Machine Learning**, and **Natural Language Processing** although there are very few things in computer science that I'm *not* interested in.  

Besides my own education, I've spent the past few years helping others learn. I am a teaching assistant at the University of Pittsburgh's Department of Computer Science where I teach [*Discrete Structures for Computer Science*](../teaching). Prior to that, I worked at the [Hill District Community Engagement Center](https://cec.pitt.edu/hilldistrict/) where I taught the [CompTIA A+ Certificate course](../teaching/) to high school students, and a course for *Girls Who Code*. Currently, I also serve as the Chief Technical Officer and Lead Software Developer for the [*Special Needs Assitance Program for Social Engagement*](https://snapfse.com) and the [*TouchTheInvisible*](https://touchtheinvisible.com) project at the University of Pittsburgh.
