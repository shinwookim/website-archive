 ![Shinwoo Kim](../assets/img/profile.jpg){: width="250" .d-block .img-fluid .rounded .float-start .me-2 .mb-0} I am student at the [University of Pittsburgh](https://pitt.edu)'s [School of Computing and Information](https://sci.pitt.edu) & [David C. Frederick Honors College](https://www.frederickhonors.pitt.edu/) where I am studying **computer science** and **mathematics**. I'm originally from *Seoul*, South Korea, but have lived in many amazing places including *Pacific Grove* (California), *Philadelphia*, and (currently) *Pittsburgh*.  

Upon completion of my undergraduate studies, I plan on applying to graduate school to further my knowledge in computer science. My research interests are in the field of **Artificial Intelligence**, **Machine Learning**, and **Natural Language Processing** although there are very few things in computer science that I'm *not* interested in.  

Besides my own education, I've spent the past few years helping others learn. I am a teaching assistant at the University of Pittsburgh's Department of Computer Science where I teach courses such as Discrete Structures. Prior to that, I taught the [CompTIA A+ Certificate](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/a) course to high school students in Pittsburgh’s Hill District.
