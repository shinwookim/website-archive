<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/profile.jpg" class="d-block img-fluid rounded floater" alt="Shinwoo Kim" width="250" loading="lazy"> I am currently an undergraduate student at the [University of Pittsburgh's](https://pitt.edu) [School of Computing and Information](https://sci.pitt.edu) & the [University Honors College](https://www.honorscollege.pitt.edu/) studying **computer science** and **mathematics**. I'm originally from Seoul, South Korea, and have lived in many amazing places including Pacific Grove (California), Philadelphia, and Pittsburgh. 

I have a passion for teaching. I was the President of the Tutoring Program at North Penn Senior High School and the Co-Founder/Instructor of the school's free SAT® prep class. Most recently, I taught the [CompTIA A+ Certificate](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/a) course to high school students in Pittsburgh’s Hill District. 

My research interests are in the field of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing although there are very few things in computer science that I'm _not_ interested in. 

Outside of school, I enjoy spending most of my time outdoors. In the winter, I am an avid skier, and during the warmer months, I enjoy hiking.
