Any time you send an email to me regarding the course, please you the following format in the subject line of the email.
> [CSXXXX] \<Pitt ID\>{%sidenote PittID "Pitt ID = Pitt E-mail minus the `@pitt.edu`. For me, that would be `shk148` because my email is `shk148@pitt.edu`. Do not put your PeopleSoft number here.
"%} \<Main Subject\>{%sidenote SubjectTitle "Include Assignment/HW title here along with a brief description of your inquiry"%} 

For example, If I had a question about Lab 2 in CS0401, my subject line might be:
