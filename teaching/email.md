## Writing a Effective Subject Line

Any time you send an email to me regarding the course, please you the following format in the subject line of the email.

> [CSXXXX] **<Main Subject\>**{%sidenote SubjectTitle "Include any key information such as assignment/HW title(s), brief description of your inquiry."%}

For example, If I had a question about Lab 2 in CS0401, my subject line might be:

> [CS0401] Issues with downloading files for lab 2

If you do not follow this format, I cannot guarantee a timely response to your email.
Also, please use your **Pitt email account**{%sidenote PittEmail "*i.e, it should end with `@pitt.edu`*" %} to send the message, and let me know **who you are**!{%sidenote Name "Include your name, and the course/section. It helps me get back to you faster."%}
