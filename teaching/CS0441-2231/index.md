published: true
---

Welcome to **CS 0441**, **Discrete Structures for Computer Science**, for the *Fall 2022* term! Throughout the term, we will study (abstract) discrete structures that are backbones of computer science. In particular, we will look at *logic, proofs, sets, relations, functions, counting, and probability, with an emphasis on applications in computer science*.

This page will provide any information for the class that I go over in recitation. Please check back for updates regularly, especially if you miss a recitation.
