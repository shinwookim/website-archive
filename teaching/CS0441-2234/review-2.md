# Problem 1
Use a direct proof to show that the sum of two odd integers is even.

# Problem 2
Show that if $n$ is an integer and $n^3 + 5$ is odd, then $n$ is even

# Problem 3
Prove that if $n$ is an odd integer, then $n^3$ is an odd integer

# Problem 4
Prove that if $x^3$ is irrational, then $x$ is irrational.

# Problem 5
Prove that for all integers $a$ and $b$, if $a + b$ is odd, then $a$ is odd or $b$ is odd.
