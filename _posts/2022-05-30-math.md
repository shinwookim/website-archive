# Definitions and Terminology
### Example 1A (Free Fall)
> Newton's Second Law of Motion states that an object's mass $m$ times its acceleration is equal to the total force acting on the object. If we let $h$ represent the height of the object, then we can restate Newton's second Law of Motion as: $m \cdot \frac{d^2h}{dt^2}=-gm$.If a baseball was dropped from the top of a 100 foot building, then this equation can be simplified to $\frac{d^2h}{dt^2}=-32\frac{ft}{s^2}$. This is an example of a **second order ordinary differential equation**.
    
#### Solve with Anti-differentiation (As seen in Calculus)
$$ 
\begin{align}
\int\frac{d^2h}{dt^2}=\int-32dt\\
\frac{dh}{dt}=-32t+C\\ \verb|Since 'Dropped' implies that | v=\frac{dh}{dt}=0,\verb| when |t=0,\\
0 = -32(0)+C \implies C=0 \\
\therefore \frac{dh}{dt}=-32t
\end{align}
$$
$$
\begin{align}
\int\frac{dh}{dt}\cdot dt=\int-32\cdot dt\\
h=\frac{-32t^2}{2}+C=-16t^2+C\\
\verb|Since h=100 when t=0,| \\
100 =0+C\implies C=100\\
\therefore h(t)=-16t^2+100
\end{align}
$$
## Definitions
An equation containg derivatives of one or more unkown functions with respect to one or more indepedenet variables, is said to be a **differential equation** (DE).

An **ordinary differential equation** (ODE) contains only ordinary derivatives of one or more dependent varibles with respect to a single independent variable.
*I.e.,* The equation does not contain any *partial derivatives*.

### Example 1: Find the order of the DE
$\frac{dy}{dx}=x^2+y^2$ (1st order) - 1st derivative
$\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}+2\frac{dy}{dx}-3y=0$ (2nd order) - 2nd derivative
$\frac{dy}{dt}+3\frac{dx}{dt}=t$ (1st order) -  both 1st derivatives

A **partial differential equation** (PDE) contains partial derivatives (usually denoted as $\partial y$ or $\partial x$) of one or more dependent variables of two or more indepedent variables.
> $\partial x$ means differentiating with respect to $x$ while considering all other variables(such as $y$) as constants.

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial}{\partial x}(3x^2+y^3)=6x \\
\frac{\partial}{\partial y}(3x^2+y^3)=3y^2
\end{align}
$$

### Example 2
$\frac{\partial y}{\partial t}+3\frac{\partial y}{\partial s}=t$ (1st Order PDE)
$\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}+3\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial y^2}+2y=0$ (2nd Order PDE)

The **order of differential equation**(ODE or PDE) is the order of the highest derivative in the equation.

### Example 3
Give the order of thhthee following DE's:
$\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}+2x\frac{dy}{dx}+3=0$ (2nd order)
$(\frac{dy}{dx})^2=2x+3$ (1st order) - 1st derivative is squared
$3xdx+5y^2dy=0$ (1st order) - We can divide by the differential $dx$ to get $3x+5y^2\frac{dy}{dx}=0$

A general nth order ordinary differential equation is often written as $F(t,y,y',....,y^{(n)})=0$ where $y^{(n)}=\frac{d^ny}{dt^n}$

An ordinary differential equation is said to be **linear** if it can be written in the form: $a_n(t)\frac{d^ny}{dt^n}+a_{n-1}(t)\frac{d^{n-1}y}{dt^{n-1}}+...+a_1(t)\frac{dy}{dt}+a_0(t)y=g(t)$ .

### Example 4
Determine which of the following DE's are linear and which are non linear

#### (a) $e^{2t}\frac{dy}{dt}=\sinh{t}\frac{d^2y}{dt^2}$
$$\begin{align}
\implies e^{2t}\frac{dy}{dt}-\sinh{t}\frac{d^2y}{dt^2}=0\\
a_1 = 2^{2t},\ a_2=\sinh{t}\\
\therefore \verb|Linear, 2nd order|
\end{align}$$
#### (b) $x^2\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}+3x\frac{dy}{dx}+2xy=\sin{x}$ $\implies \verb|Linear|$
#### (c) $\frac{d^3y}{dt^3}=-3t$ $\implies \verb|Linear|$
#### (d) $y^2\frac{d^2y}{dt^2}=\frac{dy}{dt}$ $\implies \verb|Non-Linear(Coeffecient must be a function of t)|$
#### (e) $(\frac{dy}{dx})^2=2x\implies \verb|Non-Linear(Derivative is squared)|$ 
#### (f) $y\frac{dy}{dt}=1$
$$\begin{align}
\verb|Divide by|\ y\ \verb|to get|\ \frac{dy}{dt}=\frac{1}{y}\\
\therefore \verb|Non-Linear|
\end{align}$$

Any function $\phi$ defined on some interval $I$, which when subsittued into a differential equation reduces the equation to an identity, is said to be a **solution** of the equation on the interval. The interval $I$ is called the **interval of definition.**

A solution which the dependent variable is expressed solely in terms of the indepedent variable (such as $y=y(t)$) and constants is said to be an **explicit solution**. An explicit solution of a differential equation that is identically zero on an interval $I$ is called a **trivial solution**.

A relation $G(t,y)=0$ is said to be an **implicit solution** of an ordinary differential equation on an interval $I$ provided there exists at least one function $\phi$ that satisfies the relation as well as the differential equation on $I$. That is, $G(t,y)=0$ defines the function implicitly.

### Example 5
> Under compound interest, the rate of change($\frac{db}{dt}$) of a bank account balance $B(t)$ is *proportional to the size*. If $7,000 is initially invested, verify that $B(t)=7000e^{kt}$ is the solutions to the initial value DE $\frac{dB}{dt}=kB$; $B(0)=7000$

> Note. Verify, here, means to subsitute the given function into the DE and check.
#### Step A
$$\begin{align}
\frac{dB}{dt}=\frac{d}{dt}(7000e^{kt})\\
=7000\cdot e^{kt}\cdot k=k\cdot B\ \checkmark\\
\end{align}$$
#### Step B
$$\begin{align}
B(0)=7000e^{(k\cdot 0)}=7000\cdot1=7000\ \checkmark\\
\implies B(t)=7000e^{kt}\ \verb|is an explicit solution|\\ \verb|to the DE: |\frac{dB}{dt}=kt\ \verb|with|\ B(o)=7000.
\end{align}$$
### Example 6
> Verify that $y=\frac{1}{x}$ is an explicit solution of the differential equation $xy'+y=0$

$$\begin{align}
\verb|To find |\ y'\ \verb|:|\\
y'=\frac{d}{dt}(x^{-1})=-\frac{1}{x^2}\\
\verb|Substitute into DE|\\
\verb|DE: LHS|=xy'+y=x(\frac{-1}{x^2})+(\frac{1}{x})\\
=\frac{-1}{x}+\frac{1}{x}=0=\verb|RHS|\checkmark\\
\therefore y=\frac{1}{x} \verb| is a solution to the DE|
\end{align}$$
### Example 7
> Verify that $y=e^{-t^2}\cdot \int_0^t e^{u^2} du+ c_1 e^{-t^2}$ is an explicit solution to the differential equation $y'+2ty=1$

$$\begin{align}
y'=e^{-t^2}\cdot\frac{d}{dt}(\int^t_0e^{u^2}du)+(\int_0^te^{u^2}dy)\cdot(-2t)e^{-t^2}+c_1e^{-t^2}\cdot(-2t)\\
\verb|Substitute into DE:|\\
\verb|LHS|=y'+2ty=e^{-t^2}\cdot e^{t^2}-2te^{-t^2}\cdot\int_0^te^{u^2}du-c_1\cdot2te^{-t^2}+2t(e^{-t^2}\int_0^te^{u^2}du+c_1e^{-t^2})\\
=1-2te^{-t^2}\int_0^t{e^{u^2}du}-c_1\cdot2te^{-t^2}+2te^{-t^2}\cdot\int_u^te^{u^2}du+2t\cdot c_1e^{-t^2}\\
=1=\verb|RHS|\checkmark\\
\therefore y=e^{-t^2}\int_0^te^{u^2}du+c_1e^{-t^2}\ \verb|is a valid solution to the given DE|
\end{align}$$
### Example 8
> Verify that $x^2+4y^2-4=0$ is an implicit solution of the differential equation$\frac{dy}{dx}=-\frac{x}{4y}$. Find the interval of the definition $I$:

$$\begin{align}
\verb|Use implicit differentiation | (\verb|wrt|\ x) \\
\verb|Given solution:| x^2+4y^2-4=0\\
2x+4\cdot 2\cdot y'\frac{dy}{dx}=0\\
2x+8y\frac{dy}{dx}=0\\
\implies \frac{dy}{dx}=-\frac{2x}{8y}\\
\verb|Substitute into DE|\\
\verb|LHS|=\frac{dy}{dx}=-\frac{2x}{8y}=-\frac{x}{4y}=\verb|RHS|\checkmark\\
\therefore x^2+4y^2-4=0\ \verb|is an implicit solution to the given DE|
\end{align}$$
## One-Parameter(one unknown constant) Family of Solutions and Particular Solutions
### Example 9
#### (a) Find the one-parameter family of solutions to the DE $\frac{dx}{dt}=5-t^2$
$\implies x(t)=\int(5-t^2)dt=5t-\frac{t^3}{3}+C$
#### (b) Find the particular solution for the initial condition $x(3)=5$
$$\begin{aligned}
x(3)=5(3)-\frac{3^3}{3}+C=5\\
15-9+C=5\\
C=-1\\
\therefore x(t)=5t-\frac{t^3}{3}-1 \verb| is the particular solution for the initial condition|\ x(3)=5.
\end{aligned}$$
