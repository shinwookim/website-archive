I am an undergraduate student at the <a href="https://pitt.edu"> University of Pittsburgh</a>, majoring in computer science and minoring in mathematics. I am currently enrolled in Pitt’s <a href="https://sci.pitt.edu">School of Computing and Information</a> and the <a href="https://www.honorscollege.pitt.edu/">Honors College</a>. I'm originally from Seoul, South Korea, and have lived in many amazing places including Pacific Grove (California), Philadelphia, and Pittsburgh. I have a passion for teaching; I was the President of the ADAPT Tutoring Program, at North Penn Senior High School, and I was the Co-Founder and Instructor of the ADAPT SAT Class. Currently, I’m involved with teaching the CompTIA A+ Certificate course to high school students in Pittsburgh’s Hill District.
Apart from programming, I am also interested in research, espcially in the field of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing. Outside of academia, I enjoy most of my time being outdoors. I spend most of my time in the woods. In the winter, I am an avid skier. During the warmer months, I enjoy mountain biking and hiking. When forced indoors, I spend my time watching movies and television shows.
