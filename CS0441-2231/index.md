blurb: |
    Welcome to <strong>CS 0441</strong>, <strong>Discrete Structures for Computer Science</strong>, for the Fall 2022 term!
    <br><br>
    Throughout the term, we will study (abstract) discrete structures that are backbones of computer science. In particular, we will look at <em>logic, proofs, sets, relations, functions, counting, and probability</em>, with an emphasis on applications in computer science.
    <br><br>
    This page will provide any information for the class that I go over in recitation. Please check back for updates regularly, especially if you miss a recitation.
