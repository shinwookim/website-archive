SNAP is a pittsburg-based organization which focuses on promoting engagement, awareness, and communication between neurodiverse and neurotypical communities. It maintains a presence as a student run organization at the University of Pittsburgh where it runs various community focused programs alongside its many partners (including [UPMC](https://www.upmc.com/)). SNAP also has a research wing which focuses on utilizing new technology to help facilitate effective and equitable communication between neurodiverse and neurotypical individuals. As a founding member, I serve on the advisory board, design and maintain the website for the organization.
