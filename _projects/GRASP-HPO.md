This project aims to adapt [GRASP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_randomized_adaptive_search_procedure) (Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure) in optimizing hyperparameter that are used to train machine learning models in the context of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS).

## Background 

This project is built on top of [existing work](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9452077)[^1] by *S. E. Quincozes, et al.* which used a GRASP-based technique for feature selection in electric substation's instrusion detection systems which utilize machine learning algorithms.
