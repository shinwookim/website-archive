PantherCatering is a web application that is designed to help manage a catering company. The application supports a full featured login system (for the owner, employees, and customers) and provides an interface where (1) customers can request events on given days (and cancel previous requests), (2) employees can sign up to work on certain events, and (3) give the owner a rundown of what events are scheduled and which employees are staffed for the particular events.

The application is backed by an SQLite database and is served server-side using Python's Flask framework.<span class="endmark"></span>
