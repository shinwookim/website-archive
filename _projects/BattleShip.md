This is an implementation of the classic board game [BattleShip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)) with support for *hotseat* multiplayer (i.e., two
players are using a laptop that they pass back and forth between turns). Rules are identical to the traditional BattleShip game with ten-by-ten grids and 3 game pieces (aircraft carrier, battleship, and a submarine). The entire game is written in vanilla JavaScript and DOM manipulation without any dependencies required.<span class="endmark"></span>
