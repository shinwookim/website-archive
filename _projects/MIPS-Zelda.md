As a 2D adventure game, made in the style of the old *Legend of Zelda* games, this project was written entirely in [MIPS assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_architecture) and designed to run on the [MARS assembler](http://courses.missouristate.edu/kenvollmar/mars/). The game implements everything from an various weapons, to enemy AI, to scoring. Source available upon request.<span class="endmark"></span>
