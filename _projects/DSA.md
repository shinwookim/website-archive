## Data Structures and Algorithms I
### Course Outline
This course emphasizes the study of the basic data structures of computer science (stacks, queues, trees, lists) and their implementations using the java language included in this study are programming techniques which use recursion, reference variables, and dynamic memory allocation. Students in this course are also introduced to various searching and sorting methods and also expected to develop an intuitive understanding of the complexity of these algorithms.

### Projects
1. Create a primitive, yet functioning implementation of the **Queue** ADT that supports randomizing indexes; Use the ADT to create a simply **Blackjack game**.
2. Implement a **doubly linked list** and use it to create a subclass that supports storing and manipulating integers of arbitrary lengths (including those outside the bounds of the standard `java.lang.Integer` object).
3. Implement the same doubly linked list and the `ReallyLongInt` class using **only recursive approaches**.
4. Implement five **sorting algorithms** (Quicksort, Median of 3 Quicksort, Random Pivot Quicksort, Median of 5 Quicksort, and MergeSort) and document and compare the performance in a formal approach.

## Data Structures and Algorithms II
### Course Outline
As the second in a two-course sequence on algorithms and data structures, this course covers a broad range of the most commonly used algorithms. Some examples include algorithms for searching, encryption, compression, graphs, and dynamic programming. The students will implement and test several algorithms. The course is programming intensive.

### Projects
1. Implement a **backtracking algorithm** that finds a legal filling of the squares of a given crossword puzzle.
2. Create a simple automatic word-completion system by:
   1. Implementing a **De La Briandias trie**.
   2. Implementing an **algorithm for retrieving a word prediction from the DLB**.
3. Implement the **LZW compression algorithm** using two approaches (Array and DLB) and compare the performance in its implementation in a formal approach.
4. Create a simulation for an Airline Routing System by using various **graph algorithms**.<span class="endmark"></span>
