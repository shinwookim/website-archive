## Data Structures and Algorithms I
1. Create a primitive, yet functioning implementation of the Queue ADT that supports randomizing indexes; Use the ADT to create a simply Blackjack game.
2. Implement a doubly linked list and use it to create a subclass that supports storing and manipulating integers of arbitrary lengths (including those outside the bounds of the standard `java.lang.Integer` object).
3. Implement the same doubly linked list and the `ReallyLongInt` class using **only** recursive approaches.
4. Implement five sorting algorithms (Quicksort, Median of 3 Quicksort, Random Pivot Quicksort, Median of 5 Quicksort, and MergeSort) and document and compare the performance in a formal approach.

## Data Structures and Algorithms II
1. Implement a backtracking algorithm that finds a legal filling of the squares of a given crossword puzzle.
2. Create a simple automatic word-completion system by:
   1. Implementing a De La Briandias trie.
   2. Implementing an algorithm for retrieving a word prediction from the DLB.
3. Implement the LZW compression algorithm using two approaches (Array and DLB) and compare the performance in its implementation in a formal approach.
4. Create a simulation for an Airline Routing System by using various graph algorithms.
