## Overview
CPU2224 is a virtual/imaginary CPU based on a 16-bit Harvard architecture with some similarities to MIPS. The logical circuit for the CPU is created using Logism, a tool for designing and simulating digital logic circuits. The virtual hardware supports loading programs written in MIPS-like assembly from a virtual ROM drive and can output to a virtual LED display Digits.<span class="endmark"></span>

### Supported Features
- Halting (`hlt`) and indicating on the dedicated LED display
- Basic Arithmetic using a custom ALU
  - `add`, `sub`, `and`, `or`, `xor`, `not`, `shl`, `shr`
- Loading immediates `li` , `lis` , `lui`
- Displaying to display using `put`
- Loading and Storing from Memory using `ld` and `st`
- Using the ALU with immediates
  - `adi`, `sbi`, `ani`, `ori`, `xri`, `sli`, `sri`
- Jumps - Unconditional and Conditional (Including Function Calls)
  - `j`, `jr`, `blt`, `bge`, `beq`, `bne`, and `jal`
