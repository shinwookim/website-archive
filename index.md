I am student at the [University of Pittsburgh](https://pitt.edu)'s [School of Computing and Information](https://sci.pitt.edu) & [David C. Frederick Honors College](https://www.frederickhonors.pitt.edu/) where I am studying Computer Science, Data Science, and Mathematics. My research interests are in the field of **Artificial Intelligence**, **Machine Learning**, and **Natural Language Processing** although there are very few things in computer science that I'm _not_ interested in. I am currently a teaching assistant at the University of Pittsburgh's Department of Computer Science where I teach [_Discrete Structures for Computer Science_](teaching/); I also serve as the Chief Technical Officer and Lead Software Developer for the [_Special Needs Assitance Program for Social Engagement_](https://snapfse.com) and the [_TouchTheInvisible_](https://touchtheinvisible.com) project at the University of Pittsburgh.
